		<h1>Biography</h1>
		<p>Hi, my name is James Collins and I am currently a senior majoring in chemical engineering at Tufts University and planning on graduating in the Spring.  My father and aunt also went to Tufts and he was an engineer as well.  Although my major is chemical engineering I also have a lot of interest in computer programming.  I hope to use my skills as a programmer to work faster and more efficiently with chemical engineering research.  On a personal note, I grew up in Reading, Massachusetts and have lived in New England my whole life.  I enjoy playing sports especially football and lacrosse, and I am a diehard Patriots and Bruins fan.</p>
